# Lesson 0 – Pronunciation and Orthography #

## Pronunciation ##

### `i` vs `y` ###

For historical reasons, there are two vowels – `i` and `y`, or their long variant `í` and `ý` – which are pronounced exactly the same. As noted later, there is a difference in pronunciation between short `i/y` and long `í/ý`. This is different from many other Slavic languages, so pay close attention to that and don’t get too confused.

Even though the pronunciation of `i` and `y` is the same, the choice may affect a pronunciation of a letter directly preceding this vowerl. More on that later on in the Orthography section.

### Vowel length ###

Each Czech vowel can be either short or long. Long vowels are written with an acute accent above the letter – `´` čárka. The letter `u` is written either with the accute accent or with a ring accent – `˚` kroužek. To make it simple, `ú` is used mostly at the beginning of the words and only rarely appear in other places. On the other hand, `ů` is used only inside of a word or at its end; it never appears as a first letter. The long vowels are pronounced approximately a half longer time than the short ones.

With an only exeption of `i/y`, the quality of the vowel does not change when they are long. `á`, `é`, `ó` and `ú/ů` are pronounced exactly as their short counterparts, only longer. Long `í/ý` is however pronounced more closed as `[i]` as opposed to the short `i/y`, which is pronounced `[ɪ]`.

In colloquial language, the last vowel in a sentence may be pronounced longer even if it is a short one. This is more common in Bohemia, especially in Prague than in Moravia and Silesia.

Even though the vowel length may affect meaning of a word, there are actually only few pairs where a misunderstanding can occur. If you have hard time telling the short vowels apart from the long ones, don’t worry, it won’t hinder your ability to understand the language. In Silesia, the long vowels aren’t pronounced at all.

### Vowel quality ###

Czech vowels are all pronouced rather open. The only exception is a long `í/ý`, which is the most closed one and it is the only one that changes in quality when it becomes long. All other vowels stay open even in their long variant.

### Palatalization ###

Some Czech consonants come in palatalized/non-palatalized pairs. The palatalized ones are mostly written with a caron accent – `ˇ` háček. The pairs are `c/č`, `s/š`, `z/ž`, `d/ď`, `n/ň`, `t/ť`, `h/ch` and `r/ř`. Only `d`, `n` and `t` become palatalized before a soft vowel `i/ě`, more on that in the Orthography section; other consonants do not change.

`ř` is the most difficult of Czech sounds. It is a palatalized alveolar trill, efectively a palatalized variant of `r`. You can imagine the pronunciation as `rž` merged together into one sound. Even many Czechs can’t pronounce this consonant correctly. If you have difficulties with it and substitute it with a plain `r`, the words will be still understandable.

### Voiced vs voiceless ###

There are also pairs of voiced/voiceless consonants in Czech. These are `ch/h`, `t/d`, `f/v`, `k/g`, `s/z` and `š/ž`. `c` and `č` have their voiced counterparts too, but they are rare and not considered distinct; they may appear written as `dz/dž`.

When a paired consonant appears in a consonant cluster, their quality change according to whether the next one in the cluster is paired voiced or paired voiceless. `lo**ď**ka` is thus pronounced as `lo**ť**ka`. A consonant `v` becomes assimilated – `poho**v**ka` is pronounced as `poho**f**ka`, but it does not trigger one – `**s**větlo` is pronounced as it should: with an `s`. The non-paired consonants do not trigger the assimilation. At the end of the word, the paired voiced consonants become unvoiced – `lo**ď**` is pronounced as `lo**ť**`.

In a consonant cluster `sh` the assimilation goes the other way and it is pronounced as `sch`. However in Moravia and Silesia it is ofter pronounced assimilated regularly as `zh`. This is most apparent in the phrase `na shledanou`.

### Di- @TODO ###

In vowel clusters `au`, `eu` and `ou`, the `u` gets reduced and the vowels are not pronounced separately. There are however some words like `p**ou**liční`, where the vowels don’t merge. These are pretty rare though.

### Stress ###

The stress is always on the first syllable of the word. Most prepositions become in the matter of pronunciation a part of the next word, so they take the stress – in the compound `n**ạ** stole`, the `na` is stressed and `sto` is not. If a word is longer, it can have more stressed syllables, this secondary stress is not as strong as the main one though.

In some dialects the prepositions do not steal the stress from the following words.

## Orthography ##

### Soft and hard vowels ###

In contrast to eastern Slavic languages, Czech has only two vowels that comes in soft/hard pairs: `i/y` and `e/ě`. If a `d/n/t` comes directly before a `i` or `ě`, it becomes palatalized – `nit` is pronounced as `ňit`, `něco` is pronounced as `ňeco`. This however doesn’t apply to loanwords like `disk` or `panika`.

If a `b/p/v` appears before `ě`, the cluster is pronounced as `bje/pje/vje`. The pronunciation of the consonants do not change at all, only the `j` sound is added. There are some words that are written with the `j`, like `vjezd`. If the stem vowel change to something different than `e`, this orthography feature disappears. Even though there is a word `na**pě**tí`, a related word `na**pja**tý` is written with the `j`.

The most strange cluster is `mě`, which is pronounced as `mňe`. A cluster `mně` is pronounced exactly the same and both `mě` and `mně` can appear in Czech words. Confusingly enough, both `mě` and `mně` are also standalone words, both being a first person personal pronoun, only in a different case.

### Multi-letter consonants ###

The only consonant written with more than one letter is `ch`. It is a soft (palatalized) and voiceless pair of `h`. It is considered as a one letter. If it appears at the beginning of a capitalized word, only the `c` becomes a capital letter. However if the word or sentence is written wholly in capital letters, both get capitalized. In abbreviations, both variants can appear.

Clusters `dž` and `dz` appear only rarely in Czech and they are not considered a single letter. The capitalization rules are the same, only in abbreviation, only the `D` would appear.

## Grammar ##

Animals of a masculine gender are animate in Czech, even in plural. That means they decline the same way as words for people and not as words for things. E.g. a plural of `medvěd` is `medvědi`. This is different from many other Slavic languages.
