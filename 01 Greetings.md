# Lesson 1 – Greetings #

## Phrases ##

### Formal and colloquial ###

The Czechs don’t use the formal phrases like “těší mě” or “rád vás poznávám” much. They also almost never ask “jak se máš”, even in formal encounters. If you ask a Czech person how they are doing, don’t be surprised to actually get an answer.

The affirmative clause “ano” is in the colloquial language often shortened to just “no”. This may be confusing for English speakers, so pay attention to that.

## Grammar ##

### Verbs ###

First person singular of verbs ending with `-i` like `děkuji` is more formal, the `-u` ending is more colloquial. When spoken, they can be freely interchange without sounding rude or on the other hand pretentions. In a written form the `-u` ending looks a little vulgar though.

The same applies to the third person plural ending `-í/-ou`. The former is rather formal, the latter is more colloquial.

### Prepositions ###

Prepositions that end with a consonant may add `-e` if the the next word begins with an incompatible consonants. The rules are however quite complex and not always clear. Compare: “Jsem z Dánska.” to “Jsem ze Slovenska.” or “Vyšel ze dveří.”.

### Pronouns ###

Plural pronouns “my” and “vy” can be inclusive or exclusive. The “we” can mean “I and you”, “I, somebody else and you” or “I and somebody else, but not you” and it must be figured out from the context. The same applies to plural “you”. Sometimes you have to ask for clarification.

### Numerals ###

Numerals _one_ and _two_ take different forms depending on the gender. The number _one_ has a different form for every gender. The number _two_ has a same form for feminine and neuter.

* jeden / jedna / jedno
* dva / dvě / dvě

When telling single digits, the number _one_ is often used in feminine as “jedna” and number two in masculine as “dva”. When counting or tallying, a word “raz” is often used for _one_.

## Pronunciation ##

The forms of verb “být” that begin with `j` are pronounced with or without the `j` depending on the meaning. If the verb connects a predicate, playing a role of an equal sign, then the `j` is dropped: “já ~~j~~sem student”. On the other hand if the verb is used as itself in the meaning of “to exist”, the `j` is there: “Myslím, tedy jsem.” In the negative form with the `ne-` prefix, the `j` is always pronounced.

## Semantics ##

### Male and female ###

The masculine variants of profession names don’t necessarily refer only to male people. “student” can be a _generic_ student without a specified gender or a _male_ student. “studentka” on the other hand means only a _female_ student.

Even though making female nouns is kind of productive, some may sound very unnatural. “doktorka” is very common and sounds natural, words like “koučka” sound strange and funny. Be cautious when making them.
