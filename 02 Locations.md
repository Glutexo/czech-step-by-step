## Semantics ##

### Transportation ###

The word “nádraží” (a station) can refer both to a railway station as to a bus station. For busses however, it is used only for bigger stations with many boarding edges and often a facility builing. To avoid ambiguity, it’s better to state “autobusové nádraží” (a bus station) instead of just “nádraží”, as the bare word more generally refers to a railway station. Concernig railways, the term can refer both to a big full-fledged train station as well as to a mere train stop.

Both train, bus and other stops with only one or two edges can be refered to as “zastávka” (a stop). The word “stanice” is more or less synonymous to “nádraží”, it just doesn’t necesarily imply the railway when used without context. The word “terminál” (a terminal) is trending recently and is used mostly for bigger inter-modal stations. However, municipalities like to use this word to exaggerate and often call “terminál” a simple hybrid tram/bus stop [in the middle of nowhere](https://mapy.cz/s/2W5aR).

In some cities, the main bus station is caled “ÚAN” (ústřední autobusové nádraží, a central bus stop). This abbreviation is then often pronounced as a singe word.

If there are more train stations in one city, the most important one is often suffixed with “hlavní nádraží” (main station) or used without a suffix at all. The smaller or auxiliary stations are then suffixed either with a district name (e.g. Praha-Vršovice) or with some other suffix like “město” (a town center), “zastáva” (a stop), “místní nádraží” (a local station) or similar. Bus stop names often consist of the name of the municipality followed by the name of the station itself, which can be almost anything from a steet name to some arbitrary identifier.

## Geography ##

### Regions ###

Czech Republic is administratively divided into fourteen regions, each with its most populated city being its capital. The country capital, Prague, forms a region of its own and being a capital of the surrounding Central-Bohemian region at the same time. Some of the regions are named by its capital, some by its location in the land, Vysočina (the highland) being an exception to both.

Here is a list of all Czech regions and their capitals sorted by its population:

* Hlavní město Praha: Praha (both a city and a region)
* Středočeský kraj: Praha (not being inside the region)
* Moravskoslezský kraj: Ostrava
* Jihomoravský kraj: Brno
* Ústecký kraj: Ústí nad Labem
* Olomoucký kraj: Olomouc
* Jihočeský kraj: České Budějovice
* Zlínský kraj: Zlín
* Plzeňský: Plzeň
* Královéhradecký: Hradec Králové
* Kraj Vysočina: Jihlava
* Pradubický: Pardubice
* Liberecký: Liberec
* Karlovarský: Karlovy Vary

The capital, Prague, is the most populated city in the country. The second largest city would be either Brno or Ostrava, depending on whether only the registered citizens of the city itself are counted, or whether the number includes the whole aglomeration.

### Travel ###

To get around the Czech Republic, the most convenient way to find your route is a connection finder [IDOS](https://jizdnirady.idnes.cz/). All transportation companies operating in the country are obliged by law to provide their timetable data to this database. As an alternative, a [young project](http://seznam.cz/jizdnirady/) ran by [Seznam.cz](http://seznam.cz/) can be used; it’s still in beta though, so be cautious.

It’s quite common to hear the word “IDOS” used for any kind of electronic time-table app. Even a slang verb derivate “vyidosit” is used in a meaning of “look up a connection on-line”.
