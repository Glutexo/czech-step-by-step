### Ten, ta, to, ti, ty, ta ##

First half is singular, second half is plural

|Case           |Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|
|---------------|---------|--------|------|---------|--------|------|
|Nominative     |ten      |ta      |to    |ti/ty²   |ty      |ta    |
|Genitive       |toho     |té      |toho  |těch     |těch    |těch  |
|Dative         |tomu     |té      |tomu  |těm      |těm     |těm   |
|Accusative     |toho/ten²|tu      |to    |ty       |ty      |ta    |
|Vocative       |—        |—       |—     |—        |—       |—     |
|Locative       |tom      |té      |tom   |těch     |těch    |těch  |
|Instrumentative|tím      |tou     |tím   |těmi¹    |těmi¹   |těmi¹ |

* ¹ Dual form is _těma_.
* ² First form is animate, second is inanimate

There are some patterns to note:

* Only masculine animate (both singular and plural) and feminine (only singular) variants have different nominative and accusative forms. Masculine animate accusative is identical to its genitive in singular and to the masculine inanimate variant in plural. This pattern applies to every declination.
* Neuter singular forms differ from the masculine ones only in nominative and accusative. These two cases are identical for every neuter declension. The sameness of neuter and masculine forms is very common for pronouns.
* Neuter plural is same as feminine singular in nominative. This is the same pattern as that of verb past tense.
* The plural forms are the same for all genders. The only exception is masculine animate nominative.
* The dual (-a) and plural (-i) instrumentative ending distinction is the same as in all other declination paradigms.

## Verbs ##

### Movement verbs – jít, jet, chodit, jezdit ###

Conjugation of the one-time (jít, jet) verbs is fairly irregular. The repetitive verbs are regular though. Also note that unlike in some other Slavic languages, the verb _jet_ (to drive) never changes its stem to _jecha-_.

#### Present tense ####

|Person|jít |jet  |jít  |jet   |
|------|----|-----|-----|------|
|1st   |jdu |jedu |jdeme|jedeme|
|2nd   |jdeš|jedeš|jdete|jedete|
|3rd   |jde |jede |jdou |jedou |

The difference between the verbs _jít_ (to walk) and _jet_ (to drive) in present tense is only in the inserted _e_.

|Person|chodit|jezdit|chodit |jezdit |
|------|------|------|-------|-------|
|1st   |chodím|jezdím|chodíme|jezdíme|
|2nd   |chodíš|jezdíš|chodíte|jezdíte|
|3rd   |chodí |jezdí |chodí  |jezdí  |

Both of the verbs _chodit_ (to walk) and _jezdit_ (to drive) are 4th class (or -í class) verbs and both in the present and past tens they conjugate the same. The endings are attached to the stable stem (chodí/jezdí), the 3rd person has zero stem both in singular and plural. (Note: In some dialects, the plural might have a non-standard ending, becoming jezdijou, chodijou. Do not say it that way.)

#### Past tense ####

Just as with every other verbs:

* The masculine inanimate form is identical to the masculine animate in sigular and to the feminine in plural.
* The neuter plural form is identical to the feminine singular.

|Gender             |jít |jet |jít|jet |
|-------------------|----|----|---|----|
|Masculine animate  |šel |jel |šli|jeli|
|Masculine inanimate|šel |jel |šly|jely|
|Feminine           |šla |jela|šly|jely|
|Neuter             |šlo |jelo|šla|jela|

The past tense stem of the verb jít (to walk) is completely irregular. The past tense verb stem of jet (to drive) loses the _d_. Also note that although the masculine singular is simillar, in other forms the verbs differ in the presence of _e_ in the stem.

|Gender             |chodit |jezdit |chodit |jezdit |
|-------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|Masculine animate  |chodil |jezdil |chodili|jezdili|
|Masculine inanimate|chodil |jezdil |chodily|jezdily|
|Feminine           |chodila|jezdila|chodily|jezdily|
|Neuter             |chodilo|jezdilo|chodila|jezdila|

These verbs are completely regular and conjugate the same. The past stem is identical to the present one.
