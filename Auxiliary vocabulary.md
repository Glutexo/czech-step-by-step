## Demonstrative pronouns ##

### Ten, ta, to, ti, ty, ta ##

First half is singular, second half is plural

|Instrumentative|tím      |tou     |tím   |těmi¹    |těmi¹   |těmi¹ |

* ¹ Dual form is _těma_.
* ² First form is animate, second is inanimate

There are some patterns to note:

* Only masculine animate (both singular and plural) and feminine (only singular) variants have different nominative and accusative forms. Masculine animate accusative is identical to its genitive in singular and to the masculine inanimate variant in plural. This pattern applies to every declination.
* Neuter singular forms differ from the masculine ones only in nominative and accusative. These two cases are identical for every neuter declension. The sameness of neuter and masculine forms is very common for pronouns.
* Neuter plural is same as feminine singular in nominative. This is the same pattern as that of verb past tense.
* The plural forms are the same for all genders. The only exception is masculine animate nominative.
* The dual (-a) and plural (-i) instrumentative ending distinction is the same as in all other declination paradigms.

## Verbs ##

### Movement verbs – jít, jet, chodit, jezdit ###

Conjugation of the one-time (jít, jet) verbs is fairly irregular. The repetitive verbs are regular though. Also note that unlike in some other Slavic languages, the verb _jet_ (to drive) never changes its stem to _jecha-_.

#### Present tense ####

|Person|jít |jet  |jít  |jet   |
|------|----|-----|-----|------|
|1st   |jdu |jedu |jdeme|jedeme|
|2nd   |jdeš|jedeš|jdete|jedete|
|3rd   |jde |jede |jdou |jedou |

The difference between the verbs _jít_ (to walk) and _jet_ (to drive) in present tense is only in the inserted _e_.

|Person|chodit|jezdit|chodit |jezdit |
|------|------|------|-------|-------|
|1st   |chodím|jezdím|chodíme|jezdíme|
|2nd   |chodíš|jezdíš|chodíte|jezdíte|
|3rd   |chodí |jezdí |chodí  |jezdí  |

Both of the verbs _chodit_ (to walk) and _jezdit_ (to drive) are 4th class (or -í class) verbs and both in the present and past tens they conjugate the same. The endings are attached to the stable stem (chodí/jezdí), the 3rd person has zero stem both in singular and plural. (Note: In some dialects, the plural might have a non-standard ending, becoming jezdijou, chodijou. Do not say it that way.)

#### Past tense ####

Just as with every other verbs:

* The masculine inanimate form is identical to the masculine animate in sigular and to the feminine in plural.
* The neuter plural form is identical to the feminine singular.

|Gender             |jít |jet |jít|jet |
|-------------------|----|----|---|----|
|Masculine animate  |šel |jel |šli|jeli|
|Masculine inanimate|šel |jel |šly|jely|
|Feminine           |šla |jela|šly|jely|
|Neuter             |šlo |jelo|šla|jela|

The past tense stem of the verb jít (to walk) is completely irregular. The past tense verb stem of jet (to drive) loses the _d_. Also note that although the masculine singular is simillar, in other forms the verbs differ in the presence of _e_ in the stem.

|Gender             |chodit |jezdit |chodit |jezdit |
|-------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|Masculine animate  |chodil |jezdil |chodili|jezdili|
|Masculine inanimate|chodil |jezdil |chodily|jezdily|
|Feminine           |chodila|jezdila|chodily|jezdily|
|Neuter             |chodilo|jezdilo|chodila|jezdila|

These verbs are completely regular and conjugate the same. The past stem is identical to the present one.

## Jaký/který ##

### Explanation ###

“Jaký” and “který” are both question or relative pronouns used to closely specify what is being talked about. They’re distinct in meaning, though picking the right one may become tricky. In vulgar speech there are cases when those are mistaken even by native speakers. In other situations the wrong pronoun can however sound strange and unnatural.

### Jaký (what) ###

This pronoun describes quality, some inner property of the thing. It’s statement opposite, when the quality is known, would be “takový” (such). “Jaký” is generally replaceable with “co za” (what kind of).

* **Jaké** jídlo máš rád? (What food do you like?) = Co za jídlo máš rád? (What kind of food do you like?)
* To je kniha, **jakou** jsi ještě nečetl. (It’s a book like none you’ve ever read.)
* **Jakou** rybu jsi chytil? Takhle velkou! (What fish did you catch? This big!)

### Který (which) ###

On the other hand “který” is a selection from some set of items. An answer to a question with this pronoun would contain “ten/tento/tamten” (this/that). In questions, if you can add “z nich/z těch _” (of them/of those _), then it’s definitely a selection.

* **Kterou** klávesu mám stisknout? Stiskni mezerník. (Which key should I press? Press the space bar.) “Jakou” might be used here if you don’t know by heart how the keyboard looks like; see below.
* **Které** z těch jídel je nejlepší? (Which of those meals is the best?)
* Zdalipak dnes mají ten koláč, **který** mi tolik chutnal. (I wonder whether they have that cake today I liked so much.)

### Comparison ###

There are situations in which it‘s essential to pick the right pronoun to convey the intended meaning.

* **Jaké** šaty si mám vybrat? (What dress should I pick?) – Here I am asking about some quality: color, material, design etc. You can say “Co za šaty…”
* **Které** šaty si mám vybrat? (Which dress should I pick?) – There is a selection of dresses and I have to choose one from them. You can say “Které z těch šatů…”

### Tricky bits ###

There are cases when the boundary between the two meaning is not clear. The most typical example is selection from a rather abstract, large group of items. “Který” is used when a specific subset is defined, “jaký” when this group it’s unknown.

* Dívka, **která** se vzteká, není milá. (A girl that gets angry easily is not nice.)
* Pro začátek sleduj filmy, **kterým** je snadno rozumět. (For the beginning watch those movies that are easy to understand.)

Even though we are referring to an inner quality of the item, we are still somehow selecting from a group. From all the girls/movies only some fulfill the condition. “Jaký” seems logically more appropriate, but it sounds rather unnatural.

* Nevím, **jaká** slovíčka se mám naučit na zkoušku. (I don’t know what vocabulary I should learn for the exam.)
* **Jaké** jídlo by tvoje rodiče potešilo? (What meal would please your parents?)

On the other hand, here we could say that we are selecting some items from a set, although virtually unlimite. Still, **jaký** is preferred. Using **který** would sound like selection from a more limited group. That’s perfectly acceptable to say, but there’s this shift in the meaning.

Both combined can sound very confusing:

* **Jaké** mají kočky oči? (What eyes do cats have?)
* Kočky mají oči, **které** svítí ve tmě. (Cats have eyes that shine in the dark.)

Sometimes both options are appropriate:

* Vyber si takovou, **jaká/která** se ti líbí. (Pick one that you like.)

This can be however a result of native speakers losing their ability to distinguish the nuances.

### Exercise ###

When picking the right word, justify your selection. It’s possible that using the other one is appropriate too, think about it, try to imagine the difference in the meaning.

#### Fill in the right word ####

1. Potkal jsem ženu, do _ jsem se hned zamiloval.
2. Nikdy nevíš, na _ lidi narazíš.
3. _ z těch knich si mám vzít s sebou?
4. Pověz mi, _ byl tvůj večer?
5. _ jsou asi jeho plány?
6. Nikdy nevěř lékaři, _ se usmívá.
7. Nemám ponětí, v _ šatech se chodí do opery.

#### Translate these sentences ####

1. For which party did you vote?
2. What is the difference between a unicorn and a rhinoceros?
3. I don’t know what color does Scyther have.
4. Which slot should I insert the card into?

#### Create you own sentences ####

1. Build a few sentences where both of the pronouns can be used, but the meaning would be different. Describe this semantic shift.
2. Coin some sentences, where the selection its unambiguous.
